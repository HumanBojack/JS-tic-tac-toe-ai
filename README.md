# Tic tac toe ai

This is a forked repo of an already working tic tac toe but without a working ai (it was basically going for the first available spot). Oh, and yeah: The guys that created the original repo made it in frenglish, sorry.

I worked with trees to do it. I'm pretty proud of how i did the computePossibilities method but i don't really like my bestMove method (i think it should be recursive). 

Anyway that was a great project and i'm happy i did it. Yay !

ps: I might come back on it to improve a few things in the future
